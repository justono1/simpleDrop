#Simple Drop Accordion Menu Plugin

This is my first plugin so I will be learning plugin best practices and trying to make this a useful tool for anyone in need of a quick accordion menu that is extremly lightweight and sexy.

##Process Documentation

I decided to document my process and exploration below and post some thoughts and links for me and whoever finds this to reference to

###Basic jQuery Plugin Best Practices

First step so far was to figure out best practices on how to start building. I read a couple of articles at various sources listed here:

- [jQuery Boilerplatee](https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate)
- [Smashing Magazine: Essential jQuery Plugin Patterns](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/)
- [Append to: Plugin Enhancements](http://appendto.com/2010/07/create-your-first-jquery-plugin-part-2-revising-your-plugin/)
- [jQuery Learning Center](http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/)

I found the Smashing Magazine article a pretty good jump start which lead me to the jQuery Boilerplate repo which I am using right now to make this plugin work. It may not be set up properly yet but I'm working on it. Next step I am going to install and configure the other programs like grunt and JShint. Even though all of this is probably over kill for this simple plugin I want to do it so I can learn the best way to do this stuff.
